## bash_profile

Ties many of the BashScripts together for a super powerful system.

## bash_rc.aliases

This is arguably the most valuable piece of the project!

These dozens of aliases make working with Linux and developing
web app software much more efficient and streamlined.

Go check it out! [bash_rc.aliases](bash_rc.aliases)

## bash-timer

Easily add Human-readable execution time for every command in bash!

The time will show up in the bottom left, immediately left of your $PS1.

![bash-timer image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1125541/93687425-7c392100-fa83-11ea-9d36-cacbe03cc725.png)

```

**To Install:**

```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hopeseekr/bash-timer/v1.5.0/install | bash
```

[**View the README.md**](bash-timer/README.md) for more information.

## ssh-autologin

on the remote server (creating the .ssh, if needed, as well.

## ssh-keyphrase-only-once.installer

Properly configures your OpenSSH client and installs `ssh-agent` in your `~/.bash_profile` in such a way
that you will only ever have to enter your SSH keyphrase once per login for anything that works with `ssh-agent`. 

## gitconfig

A highly-optimized .gitconfig for seasoned software developers ready to increase their daly productivity.

Quickly switch the current repo to using your main alterego account for an previously-committed commit.

    git ego

The reverse of `git alterego`.

    git resign <hash>

Quickly resign bulk commits from <hash> to the latest.

This is particularly utilitarian when your GPG key expires and you need to renew it and then resign.

    git c: checkout
    git cp: cherry-pick
    git cpm: cherry-pick for Merge commits

Utility aliases to make git more efficient to use.

## tar-sorted
 
Create tar files automatically sorted by file name.

This is particularly helpful on random-order file systems, such as ext4.

With the Bettergist Collector, we use this to be able to roughly estimate
how long compressing and extracting multiple-gigabyte files with millions
of files will take.

It is a drop-in replacement for `tar`, and uses the same arguments.

Optionally, you can install the function directly into your ~/.bashrc.

## cron.daily/00_clear-cache

- Empties out the ~/.cache directory of every non-root user.
- Empties out Pacman's package cache directory.

This can optionally use [nullfsvfs](https://github.com/abbbi/nullfsvfs) in order to limit wear-and-tear on SSDs.

## cron.daily/01_purge-locales

Removes every non-EN locale file every day.

This saves, usually, 400-1000 MB of space.

## cron.hourly/btrfs-snapshot

Takes BTRFS snapshots of / every hour on the hour.

## cron.daily/btrfs-snapshot

Cleans up the prior day's hourly snapshots while keeping the daily ones.

## cron.hourly/php-clean-tmp

Cleans up otherwise-useless PHP temp files, which is very useful on busy servers.
* Old session files that haven't been modified in the last hour.
* phpunit temp files.
* phpstan temp files.

## american-date

A utility to print out dates in the American format

    Fri, 19 January 2024 05:49:20 CST

## changelog-maker-lite

## launch-browser <browser-path>

1. It detects if the user is running Wayland. If so, for Chromium-based browsers, it will pass 
   the flags necessary for it to run in native-Wayland (not XWayland) for superior performance.
2. It will always launch using the Gnome Keychain, so that you won't lose all of your cookies and
   permanent logins every time you switch to KDE, and vice-versa.

## ls-by-min <MB>

Returns a list of files sorted by file size, descending, that are at least X MB big.

## random-file

Picks a random file in a directory / PWD.

## stream-to-youtube

## sudoers.d/00_prompt_once

This will make `sudo` only ask for your password ONE TIME during
a single boot. It won't ask across terminals and it won't time out.
On reboot, it will automatically expire.

## sync-watch

Displays how many megabytes still need to be written to [slow] disks.

    Every 5.0s: grep -e Dirty: -e Writeback: /proc/meminfo                                                    asus-z13: Fri Jan 19 07:09:32 2024

Shows the password of the currently connected Wi-Fi AP.

## x265.sh

Transcodes to x265 HEVC via ffmpeg using Intel's graphics card.

# Esoteric Utilities

## esoteric/arch-pacman-dupe-cleaner

Aids in automagically repairing duplicate Pacman database entries in Arch Linux.

It's meant to resolve the rare problem: "error: duplicated database entry 'foo'"

## esoteric/git-shallow-pull

Shallow updates a shallow `git clone --depth 1` repository.

## esoteric/init-btrfs-rootfs

In Arch Linux, a btrfs setup puts every single file in /. This greatly limits
the ability to properly manage the system, with subvol=5 having nothing but
subvolumes.

This script does the following:

* Creates new root-level snapshots: `@rootfs` (/), `@snapshots`, `@important`, and `@home`.
* Moves files `/` into `/@rootfs`, `/home` into `/home` and creates new `/snaps` and `/important`.
* Creates `/media/true-root` that is auto-mounted to `/ (subvol=5)`.
* Integrates with the `cron.d` auto-snapshot cronjobs in this project
   * `/` is snapshotted daily in `/snaps/daily/YYYY-MM-DD.
   * `/important` is snapshotted **hourly** in `/snaps/important/YYYY-MM-DD/HH`.
   * `/important` is set for compression-enabled.
   * Sets up `/home` to quota-enforced based on 10% of the total disk space per-user,
     and 50% of the total disk space for every user.
   * The `/home` snapshot is set for compression-enabled.
   * The `/home` has rolling 7-day snapshotting for user's `.*` files, 
     except for `cache` directories (when using [cron.daily/00_clear-cache]).

### The Problem

Arch Linux sticks all of / in the main BTRFS subvolume (ID=5).

This means that common snapshotting and subvolume tasks,
particularly rolling back to a previously (e.g., working)
root subvolume is exceptionally difficult and requires a
rescue boot, etc.

### The Solution

The provided solution hotfixes the situation, hopefully without
the need for a rescue disk, on a live environment. However,
you really ought to have a rescue disk prepped in avance.

And for the love of God, make backups first!

![btrfs-init-rootfs](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1125541/94771567-231f9600-037d-11eb-8032-50d2b5873f36.png)

## esoteric/clone-github-repos.php

Automagically downloads all of the GitHub repositories of a user or or an organization.

## Bash Framework

### is_root

When run standalone, it will echo either "Running as root" or "Not running as root".

When called as a function, it will return either `true` or `false`.

## wait_until_mouse_or_keyboard_event

Blocks the executing program until a key is pressed, the mouse is moved, or a mouse button
is pressed, anywhere, irregardless of window focus.

It will echo one of the following: KEYBOARD_KEY, MOUSE_CLICKED, or MOUSE_MOVED.

Can be run either standalone or as a function.
